Selection process, rational for the selection process. 
Past keynote speakers 
we need a list of all previous keynote speakers because it kept coming up in various discussions as people suggested new names
We could create a network visualization of the previous keynote speakers (Husnain)
People who were suggested as keynote speakers but did not make it -> we can get this from the drive
